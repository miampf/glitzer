## About

Glitzer (german for "glitter" or "sparkle") is a library for gleam that helps
you create progress bars and other fancy progress reporting and command line
utilities. It is written in pure gleam and supports javascript and erlang.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Simply run

```sh
gleam add glitzer
```

in your projects root directory to add the library to your project.

## Usage

You can access the progress bars with `import glitzer/progress`.

### A simple progress bar

```gleam
import gleam/int
import gleam/iterator

import glitzer/progress

pub fn main() {
    let bar = 
        progress.new_bar() 
        |> progress.with_length(100)
        |> progress.with_fill(progress.char_from_string("+"))
        |> progress.with_empty(progress.char_from_string("-"))
        |> progress.with_left_text("Doing stuff: ")
    iterator.range(1, 100)
    |> progress.each_iterator(bar, fn(bar, i) {
        progress.with_left_text(bar, int.to_string(i) <> " ")
        |> progress.print_bar
        // do some other stuff here
    })
}
```

### Progress bar templates

Glitzer also provides some premade templates for progress bars. All of these
templates have a default length of 100. As an example, here is how you could use
the `fancy_slim_arrow_bar` template.

```gleam
import glitzer/progress

pub fn main() {
    let bar = progress.fancy_slim_arrow_bar()
    do_stuff(bar, 0)
}

fn do_stuff(bar, count) {
    case count < 100 {
       True -> {
            let bar = progress.tick(bar)
            progress.print_bar(bar)
            // some heavy lifting
            do_stuff(bar, count + 1)
        }
       False -> Nil 
    }
}
```

All templates can be found in the
[documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/glitzer/glitzer/progress.html)

### Spinners

Import spinners into your project using `import glitzer/spinner`.

```gleam
import glitzer/spinner

pub fn main() {
  let s =
    spinner.default_spinner()
    |> spinner.with_left_text("Imma spin >:3 ")
    |> spinner.with_finish_text("I'm dizzy :(")
    |> spinner.spin // this will continuously spin your spinner

    // do some stuff
    
    // update the text
    spinner.with_left_text(s, "Now imma spin some more :] ")
    |> spinner.with_frame_transform(fn(s) {"<" <> s <> ">"})

    spinner.finish(s) // clear the line and print the finish text
}
```
